## Summary
This application is an expense tracker that allows the user to input the date, place, amount, and payment type.  This data is displayed in a HTML table and the user may delete entries from the table.  This project was rewarding to style and was my first real attempt at using nested flexbox to align the labels with inputs and format the output table appropiately.  The JavaScript in this project is very similar to my 'to do list' app, ensuring a foundation of utilizing the DOM to create and remove HTML elements; however, I used this opportunity to further my software development: comprising multiple functions to further my understanding of the single responsibility principle and refine my practice of reasonable, easy to read function and variable names.
